### In practice

This is how we approaching a game engine to Android. We initially tried to port the rendering as one large blob. This was almost impossible, as it was extremely difficult to tell what was broken, and where bugs were coming from.

However, we took a step back and tried a new approach. We starting with rendering a simple triangle on device, the simplest version of what we needed to do. This created a path by which we could move towards success. We then added bits on to this, piece by piece, but at every stage having a working version. 

Many of the pieces were 'faked' to start. This allows the necessary construction of the macro structure, as well as it's iteration.
