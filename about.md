I started programming at a young age, 9 or so, and have loved it ever since. When I was a kid my dad had a rule that if I programmed for an hour and a half, I could play video games for half an hour. And I played a lot of video games. My first language was C#, but since then Iâ€™ve branched out and recently also enjoy C++ and various web languages. My brother and I have programmed together since we were kids, and will continue to do so into the future I hope. 

When I am not programming I play various musical instruments, and study Japanese when I get the chance. I find that there is a lot of overlap between programming and seemingly unrelated areas of study, so I try to do as many different things as I can. Cheers!
