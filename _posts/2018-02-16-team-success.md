# What makes a team successful?

## Good Atmosphere

### Overview
In my experience, the most fundamental layer of getting a team to work is to first create a good atmosphere. 

### Reduce Toxicity

This will cause team members go from a deep ache in their heart to simply doing an unplesant task. Team members who are hurting will generate toxicity, this must be neutralized with graditude, positivity, and positive body language. 

### Improve atmosphere
Avoid any sort of blaming, and take personal responsibility for the most unplesant tasks, and others will follow your example.

Any team will have friction and issues, 

If you parachute into the 'project from hell deathmarch',  This improves how everyone _feels_, 
A good atmosphere can be created by first eliminating it's opposite, toxicity.

This means 
It is easiest to understand what a Good Atmosphere is by first understanding it's opposite. Toxicity. We've all been there, that project from hell. A miasma of despair hangs over the office, going to get coffee I idly wonder where the project went wrong?  The office is a miasma,  I explain in excruciating detail the personality faults of everyone, excepty myself, of course. Lifeless eyes turn to you as you go to get coffee, you wonder if you didn't actually accidently walk on to the set of The Walking Dead. 

We want to create the opposite of that. 



I hear in excruciating detail all the very specific  You are used to hearing in excruciating detail why the last  Most effort is use to explain in excruciating detail exactly why the last catastrophe was someone else's fault. Coworkers start


To understand what a good atmosphere 
Creating a good atmosphere on a team acts like lubricating oil, to make sure the minimize friction from the inevitable stepping on each other's toes.

A good atmosphere is the opposite of toxicity. Toxicity is created from bitterness, so to combat it the opposite emotion, gratitude must be used. 

The easiest

## Meaning

I think teams feel they're doing something meaningful if given the chance upfront before the project to express and outline what and how they would like to approach something and effectively have a say in the vision, as opposed to having a leader simply tell them what they need to do.

It's difficult to feel something is not meaningful if they themselves had a hand in shaping how it went.

On a more implementation level I think they feel there is meaning when management gets together with them at the end of each quarter - communicate each level and item that is considered a win and give credit where credit is due. In particular small incentivations that close the loop on vision and results. Also for missed and losses people still want transparency so that they feel they're always in the loop of honesty.

I found that if management hides failures people immediately think they're doing stupid useless things.

Treat them as if they are more intelligent than you and can read between the lines. Outlining losses is okay as long as it's the truth.

Bringing meaning to a team is not about avoiding struggle it's about successfully conquering the struggles together. There is no higher meaning to me than to resolve a problem or difficulty as a team that nobody could have solved on their own.
