# What makes a team successful?

## Good Atmosphere

### Overview
In my experience, the most fundamental layer of getting a team to work is to first create a good atmosphere. How people feel is generally more important how they think. Most decisions are made emotionally (feeling mind) then rationalized post-hoc. (thinking mind) The opposite of a good atmosphere is toxicity. A good atmosphere reduces friction which will lead to trust between team members. This will allow them to work together and communicate.

### Reduce Toxicity
If you are bitter, feel graditiude instead as it is the opposite emotion.
Don't blame others, take personal responsibility instead.

### Increase Good Atmosphere
Be positive, empathize.
Smile and use positive body language.
Be funny and tell jokes, especially self deprecating ones.

## Communication
It's all about communication! The reason to create a good atmosphere is so that the team can communicate with each other.

Understand things from their perspective

Open atmosphere

Active listening

Actually listen to what your coworker is saying - meditate on it.

Assume the person you are listening to is smarter than you.

Tell the truth.

## Meaning
It's all about meaning! The reason to be able to communicate is to do something meaningful.

I think teams feel they're doing something meaningful if given the chance upfront before the project to express and outline what and how they would like to approach something and effectively have a say in the vision, as opposed to having a leader simply tell them what they need to do.

It's difficult to feel something is not meaningful if they themselves had a hand in shaping how it went.

On a more implementation level I think they feel there is meaning when management gets together with them at the end of each quarter - communicate each level and item that is considered a win and give credit where credit is due. In particular small incentivations that close the loop on vision and results. Also for missed and losses people still want transparency so that they feel they're always in the loop of honesty.

I found that if management hides failures people immediately think they're doing stupid useless things.

Treat them as if they are more intelligent than you and can read between the lines. Outlining losses is okay as long as it's the truth.

Bringing meaning to a team is not about avoiding struggle it's about successfully conquering the struggles together. There is no higher meaning to me than to resolve a problem or difficulty as a team that nobody could have solved on their own.
