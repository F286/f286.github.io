# What makes a team successful?

## Good Atmosphere

Positivity

Body language

How team members feel as opposed to what they think

## Communication

Understand things from their perspective

Open atmosphere

Active listening

## Meaning

I think teams feel they're doing something meaningful if given the chance upfront before the project to express and outline what and how they would like to approach something and effectively have a say in the vision, as opposed to having a leader simply tell them what they need to do.

It's difficult to feel something is not meaningful if they themselves had a hand in shaping how it went.

On a more implementation level I think they feel there is meaning when management gets together with them at the end of each quarter - communicate each level and item that is considered a win and give credit where credit is due. In particular small incentivations that close the loop on vision and results. Also for missed and losses people still want transparency so that they feel they're always in the loop of honesty.

I found that if management hides failures people immediately think they're doing stupid useless things.

Treat them as if they are more intelligent than you and can read between the lines. Outlining losses is okay as long as it's the truth.

Bringing meaning to a team is not about avoiding struggle it's about successfully conquering the struggles together. There is no higher meaning to me than to resolve a problem or difficulty as a team that nobody could have solved on their own.
