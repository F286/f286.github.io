title: What is a Neural Network?
published: true
---

A neural network is a simulation which emulates the structure of a brain. Instead of telling the computer what to do, we create _neurons_ and _connections_, then train the networks with data. For example, to detect what is in a picture, if we give enough pictures of **cats** and **dogs**, we can train the network to tell the difference.

## How exactly do we train them?

Well, we cheat. We show it images we know the answer to. If it it wrong, we look at the network and 'tweak' the values so it gives the right answer. We can calculate how much we have to change values in the neurons to get the 'correct' answer. This is done using calculus and derivatives.

Is this how the human brain learns?
