Create a good atmosphere, this will give you allies.

Speak and write properly, this will give you power.

Learn to accept suffering, then you will transcend it and

Become some sort of hero, this will give your life meaning.

Pay attention and speak the truth.

Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.
