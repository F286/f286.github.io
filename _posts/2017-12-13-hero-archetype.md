Pay attention, speak properly, and tell the truth.

The truth will compel change, do this even if it feels bad. 

A phoenix burns away and dies before being reborn into something greater.

Love yourself and calm the mind, this will win back the heart.

Detach when emotional, this will free the mind.

Create a good atmosphere, this will give you allies.

Speak and write articulately, this will give you power.

Learn to accept suffering, then you will transcend it.

And become some sort of hero, this will give you meaning.

Pay attention, speak properly, and tell the truth.

Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.
