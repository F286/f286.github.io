Your identity is what you identify with. What do you consider yourself to be? For example, you may put yourself in the 'object-oriented' programming camp. If someone says, "Hey, we are in a new environment. The standard style here is component-based so we should that instead." the visceral response is something like 'burn the heretic'. This can be counter productive though, if that is actually the correct thing to do.

After a considerable amount of painful learning and perhaps a failed project or two, you might learn that dogmatically keeping yourself in the 'object-oriented' camp is a bad idea. "Okay, maybe I could try component-based programming," you think. Then you learn it, and things improve. What is causing this dogmatic behaviour, and how can it be avoided?

The issue is that you are naturally creating a category structure, then conflating your identity with a very specific piece of it. It becomes difficult to learn new things if that new thing could potentially destabilize a category that is part of your identity. What is the solution to this problem?

The solution is to transcend the category structure. Your identity must become the thing that is able to creatively and pragmatically update it's own category structure. This is repersented archetypically as the hero. The hero sacrifices the part of himself that is outdated, which dies then is reborn. This is the voluntairly acceptance of the painful transformation process of updating one's own beliefs. Since your identity is now associated with the process that updates the value structure, and not the value structure itself it will no longer get in the way of learning.

This archetype is seen in movies as the hero. The hero has a deep flaw, which must be painfully overcome through meaningful sacrifice, only then can he acheive victory.

This is related to what the eye floating above the pyramid on the back of the American dollar bill repersents. The eye represents logos, which is your attention and truthful speech, and shares the same root word with logic. The pyramid repersents order, which is all the structures and hierarchies of our society. To transcend your category structure is to see the entire structure objectively, as well as where you fit into it. If you associate yourself with the eye instead of the pyramid, you will not have to fight everytime you update a category. You may even be able to creatively modify the category structures that we all swim in.

Identify with the hero.
