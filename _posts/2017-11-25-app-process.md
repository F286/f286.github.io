# What is the most effective order of doing things?

When creating apps at Tinybop generally the same sort of issues came up even though the content each app was quite different. 

For example, once the art assets were created, it constrained the design since anything too different would involve throwing away work. Since design is already constrained by multiple factors, adding one more factor could make things difficult. The solution we came up for this was to wait to create art assets until after we were happy with the design of a prototype.

In general, a lot of pain was avoided by carefully choosing the order that we did things. Below is the process we followed at Tinybop, any process that follows this sort of ordering should work however.

## Prototyping

Prototyping is the iteration of the structure of an app. It involves mostly designers (to figure out what to do) and programmers (to figure out how to do it). Often there are technical constraints or something 'doesn't work' very well when actually tested on device, there needs to be an iteration loop involving the designer and the programmer.

**It is important to make multiple fundamentally different prototypes, and then to pick the most effective one.** If there is only one prototype then it is just development, not a prototype. There is a strong tendency to get *locked in* to an approach if only one approach is being examined, which will lead to medium to long term problems.

## Building

Building is the adding of art assets to the app, and fleshing out the app based on the prototype. It involves artists (to create art assets), programmers (to create the app) and designers (to make sure the overall vision is being achieved). Once art assets are created, it becomes very difficult to change anything, so we should be careful on the timing of the creation of art assets.

## Polishing

Polishing is where we make the app really good. It involves mostly programmers. I general we should not change functionality here, but fix all the little issues that will make the app seem slightly cheap.
