# 5 Rules for Co-dev

**co-dev**
*(noun)*
Abbreviation of co-development. To work towards a common goal with another team. Esp. remote or from a different company.

The greatest obstacle a co-dev studio must overcome is:

Why can't we just do this in-house?

It is more difficult to have a successful co-dev team than a local team. There are more variables that can go wrong when the team is separated physically.

Mistakes that would hamstring a local team will often shatter a co-dev team.

However, by focusing on the right areas, it is possible to create a co-dev team that will shock you with it effectiveness.

## Chat with video every morning

Not being in the same room is a hurdle that a co-dev team must overcome. People tend to naturally congeal if they are in the same space together. If they are not, these opportunities and rituals must be intentionally constructed.

Encourage a good atmosphere. Keep things relaxed and don't be afraid to make a joke. Keep things professional, but recognize you are talking to a human, not a robot.

Focus on building a good relationship with teammates. This will build up *trust*, the ability to believe another person. As direct oversight is limited, being able to take someone at their word is a necessity to move forward.

## Be Indispensable
### Provide value not obtainable anywhere else
Ideally do this in a positive way, ie combination of skills, expertise that is not available locally.
This can be done in 'not good' way as well by trying to create a dependence. This is what every company tries to do. That is why they have proprietary platforms, standards, etc.. 

## Work to consistently raise the bar

## Work in the same space
Work in a shared space
JIRA, etc. Put work and personal task organization in a spot that is naturally visible to other team members.

## Be honest

## Focus on Communication

Be honest about both successes and risks. 

### Notes

be specific and action oriented.
