# 5 Rules for Co-dev

**co-dev**
*(noun)*
Co-develop. To work with another team. Often used when teams are at different locations.

The greatest challenge to overcome when working co-dev is.

Can't we just do this in-house?

You can get away with a lot when the team is in the same room. When a team is not in the same physical space, much of what we take for granted must be done intentionally.

It's not rocket science however. With a solid understanding of the fundumentals, you will be able to create a highly effective co-dev team.

Let's look at how to do this below.

## Chat with video every morning

Not being in the same room is a hurdle the team must overcome. We tend to naturally congeal if we are in the same space together. If we are not, these opportunities and rituals must be intentionally constructed.

Chat with video every morning. Encourage a good atmosphere. Keep things relaxed and don't be afraid to make a joke. Keep things professional, but remember you are talking to a human, not a robot. Balance being considerate with being yourself.

Focus on building a good relationship with teammates. This will build up *trust*, the ability to believe another person. As direct oversight is limited, being able to take someone at their word is a necessity to move forward.

## Without them we're toast

Provide something that is critical to your co-dev partner, that they cannot find locally. That could be a level of quality or expertise in several areas that can be uniquely combined.

Without this, your co-dev partner has no logical reason to continue working with you. As many things are easier with someone in-house, this is an unstable situtation to be in as you could be replaced at any moment with little to no downside to them.

By providing critical value, the relationship will have a solid foundation.

The flip-side to this is to artifically create a dependence, such as Apple locking iMessage to only work within their ecosystem. This is a sliding scale, but be careful with this as it can be perceived badly.

## Work to consistently raise the bar

## Work in the same space
Work in a shared space
JIRA, etc. Put work and personal task organization in a spot that is naturally visible to other team members.

## Be honest

## Focus on Communication

Be honest about both successes and risks. 

### Notes

be specific and action oriented.
